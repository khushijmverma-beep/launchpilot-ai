          LaunchPilot does not pretend to predict funding outcomes or guarantee product-market fit. Findings
          include evidence labels and source quality scoring so you can judge confidence before acting.

        <p>
          You approve every publish step. The roadmap is a starting point — not a mandate. Human judgment stays
          in the loop from interview through build.

          Your founder profile and project data are stored in your account on Firestore. Interview transcripts
          and project details stay private to you — we do not sell founder context or use it for unrelated
          training.
